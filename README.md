# Pizza Ordering System

## Final Project - Software Design Patterns Course

### Group: SE-2226
### Team Members: Imanzhusup Saparbek
### Teaching Assistant: Arailym Bakenova
### Astana, 2023

## Project Overview

### Project Idea:

The project simulates a basic pizza ordering system where users can select different types of pizzas, add extra toppings, choose a payment method, and place an order. It incorporates several design patterns (singleton, strategy, decorator, adapter, factory, and observer) and adheres to SOLID, DRY, and KISS principles.

### Purpose of the Work:

The primary purpose of the project is to demonstrate the implementation of various design patterns and coding principles in a Java application. It serves as an educational example to showcase how these patterns can be applied in a real-world scenario, such as a pizza ordering system.

### Objectives of the Work:

#### Design Patterns Implementation:

- Demonstrate the use of design patterns like singleton for the PizzaShop, strategy for payment methods, decorator for pizza toppings, adapter for ordering pizzas, factory for pizza creation, and observer for order notifications.

#### SOLID Principles:

- Follow SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion) to ensure a modular and maintainable codebase.

#### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):

- Avoid code duplication by creating reusable components and leveraging inheritance and composition where appropriate.

#### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):

- Keep the codebase simple and straightforward, focusing on clarity and readability. Avoid unnecessary complexity.

#### User Interaction:

- Provide a basic command-line interface for users to interact with the pizza ordering system.
- Allow users to select pizza types (e.g., Margherita, Pepperoni), add extra toppings, choose payment methods (credit or cash), and place an order.

#### Observer Pattern for Notifications:

- Utilize the observer pattern to notify external services (e.g., DeliveryService) when an order is placed.

## Instructions for Running the Project:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Run the main application file.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the pizza ordering system.

Feel free to explore the codebase and learn from the implementation of various design patterns and coding principles.
